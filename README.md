# COVID-19 Trends Analysis with Python

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the trends of COVID-19 using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and forecasting using FB Prophet. The forecasts are made for confirmed cases, death cases, recovered cases, and active cases.

## Data Cleaning
The dataset used for this analysis is cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis process. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity.

## Visualization
Visualizations are created to provide insights into the trends of COVID-19. Various plots and charts are generated to visualize the data, including time series plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

## Prediction Using FB Prophet
Facebook Prophet (FB Prophet) is utilized for making predictions on COVID-19 trends. FB Prophet is a forecasting tool designed for time series analysis and is particularly effective for forecasting trends with irregularities and seasonality.

### Forecast on Confirmed Cases
Using FB Prophet, forecasts are generated for confirmed COVID-19 cases. These forecasts provide insights into the potential future trajectory of confirmed cases based on historical data.

### Forecast on Death Cases
Similar to confirmed cases, forecasts are made for COVID-19 death cases using FB Prophet. These forecasts help in understanding the potential mortality trends of the pandemic.

### Forecast on Recovered Cases
Forecasts are generated for COVID-19 recovered cases using FB Prophet. These forecasts aid in predicting the recovery trends and understanding the overall impact on public health.

### Forecast on Active Cases
FB Prophet is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases, which are essential for assessing the current spread and managing healthcare resources effectively.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the trends of COVID-19 using Python. By leveraging data cleaning techniques, visualization tools, and FB Prophet for forecasting, we gain a better understanding of the pandemic's impact and potential future outcomes.
